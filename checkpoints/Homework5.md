Homework 5

1. What I Planned To Do <br>
Directly pulled from my last checkpoint:<br>
In short, I will complete MonsterSpawner so it can spawn monsters, have one room for the player to run around in, and have the ability to attack and kill (or be killed by) monsters.<br>


2. What I Actually Accomplished <br>
This time around I actually accomplished more than I set out to do! The game is fully playable now! <br>
- <b>MonsterSpawner is complete: </b> I've finished creating a MonsterSpawner that follows the factory pattern. It's responsible for creating monsters and also randomizes their stats slightly. It has an additional method that then finds a free location for that monster to spawn in at. Monsters spawn after a certain number of turns taken by the Player
- <b>Attacking: </b> The Player and Monsters can now attack and deal damage to each other. They have differing stats that make some monsters deal and take damage differently. Damage is also slightly randomized to make the game more interesting.
- <b>Monster and Player Death: </b> Monsters and the Player can now die. For monsters, the UI outputs a message and the monsters are removed from the list that tracks them. For the Player, death triggers a game over.
- <b> Game Over and Restart: </b> Once the Player dies, the game goes to a Game Over screen, when it shows the number of turns the Player survived and lets the Player click to reset. Separate screens are done through Arcade Views.
- <b> Title and Instruction Screen: </b> There is now a Title screen with the name of the game and my name. There's also a thorough instructions screen with details on what the Monsters and Player look like, how to move, how turns advance, and how to attack.

3. What I Had Planned For The Next Deadline <br>
No longer applicable since this is the last deadline.
